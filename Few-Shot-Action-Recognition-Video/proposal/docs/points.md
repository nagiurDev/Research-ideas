> Few-shot action recognition suffers from limited training data, hindering model generalization.  This research proposes a novel approach to improve few-shot action recognition by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide data augmentation. We will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to generate descriptive variations of actions and then use these descriptions to inform the parameters of various data augmentation techniques. We will evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets like Something-Something and HMDB51 using 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot accuracy.  We anticipate achieving a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to enhance few-shot learning in computer vision.
