\section{Timeline}

The following Gantt chart and table outline the proposed timeline for this research, encompassing key milestones and deliverables. This timeline is subject to adjustments in consultation with my advisor as the research progresses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Months 1-2:} Focused Literature Review, culminating in a concise summary of relevant work. Proposal development and defense, resulting in an approved proposal with a scope adjusted for the 12-month timeframe.
    \item \textbf{Months 3-5:} Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM for action description generation, potentially focusing on a subset of actions.
    \item \textbf{Months 4-6:} Development and evaluation of the augmentation parameter mapping model, potentially using a simplified architecture.
    \item \textbf{Months 6-9:} Experiments on a primary dataset (e.g., HMDB51 or a subset of Something-Something), focusing on key comparisons and analysis.
    \item \textbf{Months 9-10:} Preparation of a conference paper submission (workshop or shorter paper format).
    \item \textbf{Months 10-12:} Thesis writing, leading to a completed thesis draft and the thesis defense within month 12.
