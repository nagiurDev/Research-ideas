    Few-shot action recognition remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of labeled data, hindering the generalization ability of deep learning models. This research proposes a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide the data augmentation process for enhanced few-shot action recognition. We will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-3, on action descriptions to generate diverse and semantically meaningful variations of actions. These descriptions will then be used to inform the parameters of various data augmentation techniques, including Mixup, CutMix, and standard transformations like rotation and jittering. The effectiveness of the proposed LLM-guided data augmentation will be rigorously evaluated on benchmark datasets like Something-Something V2 and HMDB51 using 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot accuracy. We anticipate a 10-15\% improvement in accuracy compared to existing few-shot action recognition methods that rely on standard random data augmentation. This research contributes a novel framework for incorporating semantic information into data augmentation, advancing the field of few-shot learning in computer vision.
