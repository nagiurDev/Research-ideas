## Research Objectives

Let's break down the generated Research Objectives section, explaining the purpose and rationale behind each objective:

**1. Develop a Framework for LLM-based Action Description Generation:**

- **Purpose:** To create a system that uses LLMs to generate diverse and meaningful descriptions of actions. This is the foundation of the proposed approach, as these descriptions will guide the augmentation process.
- **Rationale:** Current data augmentation lacks semantic understanding. LLMs can provide this by generating descriptions that capture variations, counterfactuals, and nuances of actions, leading to more relevant augmented samples. The evaluation component ensures that the generated descriptions are useful and meaningful.

**2. Design an Augmentation Parameter Mapping Method:**

- **Purpose:** To bridge the gap between textual descriptions (from the LLM) and the numerical parameters used in data augmentation techniques.
- **Rationale:** This is a crucial step for making the LLM guidance actionable. The mapping method will translate the semantic information from the descriptions into concrete transformations that can be applied to the training data. Evaluating the quality and realism of the augmented samples ensures the mapping is effective.

**3. Evaluate the Effectiveness of LLM-Guided Augmentation:**

- **Purpose:** To demonstrate that the proposed approach actually improves few-shot action recognition performance.
- **Rationale:** This is the core evaluation objective. Using benchmark datasets and standard metrics allows for direct comparison with existing methods. The focus on statistical significance ensures that the observed improvements are not due to random chance.

**4. Compare with State-of-the-Art Methods:**

- **Purpose:** To position the proposed approach within the broader field of few-shot action recognition.
- **Rationale:** Comparing against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the relative effectiveness and potential impact of the proposed approach. It provides context and strengthens the argument for the novelty and contribution of the research.

**5. Analyze the Impact of Different Design Choices:**

- **Purpose:** To understand the influence of various components of the proposed framework and identify optimal configurations.
- **Rationale:** This objective allows for a deeper understanding of how different LLMs, prompting strategies, and augmentation techniques interact and affect performance. This can lead to valuable insights and guide future research in this area.

**Overall Effect:**

Fine-tuning on action-related data and using clever prompting strategies ensures descriptions are relevant to the task. Evaluating description quality through human judgment and semantic similarity metrics ensures the descriptions are both understandable and closely related to the actual actions.

**2. Augmentation Parameter Mapping:**

- **Purpose:** This stage details how the textual descriptions from the LLM will be translated into numerical parameters usable for data augmentation.
- **Rationale:** This bridges the gap between the LLM's textual output and the requirements of image/video transformation functions. Exploring different architectures for the mapping model helps optimize this translation. Evaluating the realism and diversity of augmented samples ensures the mapping process effectively captures the semantic meaning from the LLM.

**3. Data Augmentation and Few-Shot Action Recognition Training:**
